In Arlington, Texas, the Tarrant Area Food Bank partnered with Aerialoop drones and Mozee autonomous vehicles to deliver over 300 grocery packages to residents in need. This multimodal delivery pilot is supported by researchers at the The University of Texas at Arlington. According to Ann Foss Planning and Program Manager for the City of Arlington’s Transportation Department, the team is taking a holistic approach: evaluating energy usage, conducting a cost-benefit analysis, and gathering feedback from participants.

As Ann puts it: “We are carefully looking at the energy usage for the program, the cost-benefit analysis, and the feedback from the participants. Did they actually like getting groceries this way? Most report that they do.” By combining sustainability goals, social equity, and cutting-edge transportation technologies, this initiative shows what’s possible when cities prioritize both innovation and inclusion.
