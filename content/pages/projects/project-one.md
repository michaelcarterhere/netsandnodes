Working on this project was a total dream. It started as a conversation sparked by a bad haircut before company headshot day. We all wanted to know: could AI fix this?

It didn't take long for me to generate ten thousand selfies. Okay maybe not ten thousand but definitely thousands. Our magic image generation recipe is written on a Five Guys napkin hidden behind a painting in an old storage locker.

I learned a ton from launching this project. Taking it from ideation to a revenue generating app was a huge undertaking. From backend development to building the frontend, from marketing to meeting with investors, it was an incredible ride. I highly recommend doing this at least once in your life.
