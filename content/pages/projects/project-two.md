When Pamela Shea asked me to contribute to a paper she was working on with Erin Cote it was perfect timing. I had been giving a lot of thought at the time to the ways LLMs could enhance immersive learning technologies like VR and XR. One of the obvious use cases was simulating human interaction. A few of the early to market simulations provided me with a glimpse of what was possible. By working with Pamela and Erin I learned a lot about the role simulations played in the training of behaviour analysts and the challenges educators face in delivering them to students. This paper provides insights on those challenges and the ways computer generated simulatios can mitigate them.

Check out the abstract below:

This rapid review explores the potential of computer-generated simulations in training future behavior analysts. While competencies in behavior analysis are critical for improving client outcomes, gaps remain in the availability and fidelity of training methods within higher education. Emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and virtual simulations, offer innovative solutions to address these challenges. This review synthesizes literature from 2019 to 2024, examining the role of computer-generated simulations in teaching essential skills at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The findings summarize existing research, identify key variables influencing training effectiveness, and highlight implications for future educational practices. By leveraging AI and virtual reality (VR), educators may enhance experiential learning, promote culturally responsive care, and improve skill acquisition for aspiring behavior analysts. This review provides recommendations to guide future research and the ethical integration of AI technologies in behavior analytic education.
